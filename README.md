# Value Manager Dapp

This project demonstrates a simple Web3 application with a Solidity smart contract and a React.js frontend. The smart contract allows setting, incrementing, decrementing, and resetting a stored value.

## Project Overview

### Components:

- **Solidity Smart Contract**: Manages a stored value with the following functionalities:
  - `setValue`: Set the value to a specific number.
  - `increment`: Increase the value by a specific amount.
  - `decrement`: Decrease the value by a specific amount.
  - `reset`: Reset the value to its initial state.
  
- **React.js Frontend**: Interacts with the smart contract through a user-friendly interface using the `ethers.js` library to connect with Ethereum.

## Prerequisites

To run the project, you need the following installed on your machine:

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm
2. [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) for compiling, deploying, and testing the smart contract
3. [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) browser extension for connecting the Dapp to Ethereum

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/web3-assessment-contract.git
cd web3-assessment-contract
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Deploy the Contract

#### Start Hardhat Local Node:

Open a new terminal and start the Hardhat local blockchain network:

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

This command will launch a local Ethereum blockchain for testing and development purposes.

#### Deploy the Contract to the Local Node:

In another terminal, deploy the contract to the running local network:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

After running this command, you will see the contract address printed in the terminal. **Note this address** for the next step.

### 4. Configure the Frontend

In the `App.js` or `index.js` file inside your React project, replace the placeholder contract address with the actual contract address generated during deployment:

```js
const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "your_contract_address_here";
```

Replace `"your_contract_address_here"` with the contract address obtained from the deployment step.

### 5. Run the Frontend

Now, you can start the frontend and interact with the deployed contract:

```bash
npm start
```

After running this command, open your browser and visit the URL provided by the terminal, typically `http://localhost:3000`.

### 6. Interact with the Dapp

You should now be able to interact with the Dapp:
- Set a new value.
- Increment or decrement the current value by a specific amount.
- Reset the value to its initial state.

## Notes

- Ensure that your MetaMask wallet is connected to the Hardhat local network.
- You can modify the contract in `contracts/Assessment.sol` and redeploy it if needed.
- If you're facing issues, make sure your MetaMask is on the same network as the Hardhat node.

## Technologies Used

- **Solidity**: For writing the smart contract.
- **Hardhat**: For development, testing, and deployment of the contract.
- **React.js**: For building the frontend.
- **ethers.js**: For interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
